### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This account has been in use from 2011 to 2021, I learned so much about how web tech works alongside with browsers and OS on this decade, I can't wait for what the future holds.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on <a href="https://tbbc.app/?old-github">TBBC APP</a> as part of my personal efforts to evolve my web authoring skills

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always curious about how other platform APIs solve user interfaces internally compared to CSS in the browsers.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: there's an email on <a href="https://tbbc.app/404">this page</a>

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Web technologies
